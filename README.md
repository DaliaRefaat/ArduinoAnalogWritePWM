# ArduinoAnalogWritePWM
Alternative implementation of the analogWrite function

Description:
This repository contains an alternative implementation of the analogWrite function in Arduino Uno without using the built-in function. The technique involves applying Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control the intensity of analog signals, providing a custom solution for users who want a different approach to analog signal generation.

Features:
PWM Implementation:

Presents an alternative method to achieve analog signal generation using PWM.
Demonstrates how to control the duty cycle to simulate the behavior of the analogWrite function.

Arduino Uno Compatible:

Designed specifically for Arduino Uno boards.
Provides a drop-in replacement or alternative to the standard analogWrite functionality.

Code Examples:

Includes examples and documentation to illustrate how to use the custom PWM function.
Demonstrates integration with other Arduino projects.

Compatibility:

Ensures compatibility with the Arduino Uno platform.
Allows users to seamlessly incorporate this custom PWM solution into their existing projects.
Customization and Optimization:

Encourages users to explore and modify the code for further customization or optimization.
Provides insights into the underlying PWM technique for educational purposes.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Include the custom PWM function in your Arduino Uno projects.
Refer to the provided examples and documentation for guidance on implementation.
Explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs.
